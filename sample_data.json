{u'username': u'Rejutka Lupex', u'text': u'A nice game, but better not to get started.\nThe problem with this game isn\'t that it\'s bad, the problem is that it isn\'t explained. Maybe there was some tutorial at the beginning, but if so, I\'ve long since forgotten most of what they said.\nThere is no in-game help to explain how the details work - for example the damage mechanic. Obviously it depends on how many skulls you combine, but what else? Enemy armor probably, and some sort of multiplier? Sometimes it seems that the enemy is healing me and then attacking at the same time.\nI\'d like to say "give it a try" if you see it cheap, but I don\'t think it\'s worth it. It does have addictive qualities, and one wants to continue - but every time I start the game, I get frustrated within minutes.\nAlso, and this is a minor nitpick, it seems they only have ONE track for combat music. It\'s nice music, very eerie and fitting. But hearing it constantly is getting old fast.\nIf you want a nice match-3 game, try Gems of War instead.
